# FlyBeacon

An application of **iBeacon** technology to travel.

## Baggage Tracking 

This repository contains a simple mockup of the baggage tracking part of our idea of application of iBeacon to travel. The app presents a basic idea of how the iBeacon technology can be used to track the arrival of your bag to the luggage belt and track the proximity of your bag to you. The proximity technology is not precise but it is pretty good nevertheless. Our effort present a basic stub at this problem using the low frequency BlueTooth technology which the iBeacons are using.
